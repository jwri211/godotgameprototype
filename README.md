# Asteroid Shooter
Contains the WIP Godot project for IT6034 - Game Development

The game has the player control a ship using the mouse, firing by clicking.

Destroy asteroids that fly towards you and pick up loot that they drop. - Powerups spawn to shoot faster!

Don't get hit by the asteroids, too many crashes and the game ends!
